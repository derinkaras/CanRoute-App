# ♻️ CanRouteApp

React Native (Expo) app for CanRoute — a field-operations platform that streamlines how cities service public garbage bins. Workers can see their daily routes, scan can QR codes, log service, and receive alerts. Supervisors can track progress in real time.

## Repositories

- Mobile App (this repo): https://github.com/derinkaras/CanRoute-App/tree/main
- Backend API: https://github.com/derinkaras/CanRoute-API

## Features

- Today's Route — ordered stops + map

---

## Tech Stack

- React Native via Expo
- Tailwind CSS with NativeWind
- React Navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Expo Barcode Scanner (or react-native-qrcode-scanner) for QR
- Expo Image Picker for photos

---

## Environment

Create a .env (or use app.config.js / expo-env as you prefer):

```
# Used by the mobile app to call the backend API
API_URL=https://your-render-service-name.onrender.com
```

Note: In development, if using a local API, ensure your device can reach your machine (use your LAN IP, not localhost).

---

## Getting Started

```
# Install deps
npm install

# Start the app
npx expo start

# iOS
i

# Android
a

# Web (optional)
w
```

Scan the QR with Expo Go to run on your device.

Example Axios client (lib/api.ts)

```ts
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000',
  timeout: 15000,
});

export default api;
```

## Core Screens

- Home: progress ring, next stop, start/end shift
- Route: list + map view, stop details
- Can Detail: scan QR, service/skip, attach photos/notes
- Alerts: resident/worker alerts, acknowledge + action
- Profile: sign-out, app version

---

## Auth

- Uses JWT from the API
- Store token securely (e.g., expo-secure-store)
- Add Authorization: Bearer <token> header to API requests

---

## Building

- Development: npx expo start
- Production (EAS): set API_URL to your Render domain and run EAS build
- App Icons/Splash: configure in app.json / app.config.js
